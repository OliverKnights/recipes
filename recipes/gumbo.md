## Gumbo
Serves 6
1hr 10
### Ingredients
- 1 onion
- 3 cloves of garlic
- 3 sticks of celery
- 3 mixed-colour peppérs
- groundnut oil
- 3 heaped tablespoons plain flour
- 3 fresh bay leaves
- 3 sprigs of fresh thyme
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 100ml red wine
- 1 x 400g tin of quality plum tomatoes
- 1 x 400g tin of chickpeas
- 200g frozen peas
- 2 fresh jalapeño chillies
- 4 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 200g okra
### Instructions
Peel and finely chop the onion, garlic and celery, and deseed and roughly chop
the peppers. Pour 3 tablespoons of oil into a large pan over a medium heat and
miy in the flour to make a paste (loose roux). Cook until dark brown, stirring
constantly so that it doesn't catch and burn. Add the chopped veg to the paste
along with the bay leaves, then strip in the thyme leaves and cook for 20
minutes, or until softened and dark nutty brown, stirring regularly (give it
some love).

Stir through the cayenne pepper and paprika, followed by the wine and allow to
reduce by half before scrunching in the tomatoes. Tip in the chickpeas (juices
and all) and enough water to cover, then simmer over a medium heat for 25
minutes, or until reduced to your preferred consistency, adding the peas for
the last 5 minutes. Season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper.
Meanwhile, finely slice the chillies, place in a bowl, and stir in the vinegar
and a pinch of salt to make a quick pickle. Dry-fry the okra in a large
non-stick frying pan on a medium heat until lightly charred, then halve and
scatter over the gumbo.

I like to serve the gumbo and pickle with fluffy rice and a handful of fresh parsley.
