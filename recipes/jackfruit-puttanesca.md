https://healthylivingjames.co.uk/jackfruit-puttanesca-pasta/

## Ingredients

- 1 can jackfruit (this can be optional and the sauce works well without it)
- 4 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 red onion finely diced
- 4 medium garlic cloves crushed
- 100 g vine tomatoes sliced into quarters
- 25 g capers roughly 2 tbsp, finely chopped
- 50 g black pitted olives roughly 20 slices into halves
- 1 heaped tsp miso paste
- 1 can chopped tomatoes
- handful Fresh parsley chopped
- Gluten free spaghetti I use brown rice

## Instructions

1. Drain the jackfruit and place into a pan of boiling water for 10 minutes to allow it to soften
2. Meanwhile prepare the onion, garlic, capers, olives and tomatoes
3. Heat a pan on a medium heat with the crushed garlic, onion to cook down for a couple minutes
4. Place the spaghetti into boiling water for roughly 8 minutes until el dente (we will be adding it to the sauce to finish off cooking)
5. Now add the tomatoes, olives and capers to cook down for a couple minutes
6. Now add the miso paste and the can of tomatoes and stir.
7. Drain the jackfruit and add to the pan and press the chunks with a fork so they break apart and stir. Leave this to cook down for a further few minutes
8. Finally with tongs take the spaghetti from the boiling water and place directly into the pan with the sauce along a small amount of the pasta water (roughly 3-4 tbsps) and a handful of freshly chopped parsley and stir thoroughly
9. Allow this to simmer together for a further few minutes before serving
