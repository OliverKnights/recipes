Serves: 2

## Ingredients
3 tbsp olive oil
1 large onion, thinly sliced
1 red pepper, cut into long slices
1 green peppers, cut into long slices
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1/4 tsp cumin seeds
1/4 tsp caraway seeds
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
1/2 tbsp tomato or red pepper purée
1 400g tin tomatoes
1 small bunch fresh coriander, roughly chopped
1 small bunch fresh parsley, roughly chopped
4 free-range eggs
40g feta, crumbled
4 tbsp thick natural yoghurt or labneh
salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

Heat the olive oil in a large, lidded frying pan. Add the onions and peppers and season with salt and pepper. Cook on a medium heat until just softened. Add the garlic and cook for a further 2 minutes. Sprinkle in the cumin and caraway seeds and the cayenne pepper. Stir in the tomato or red pepper purée and cook for a couple more minutes until the paste starts to separate. Add the tomatoes with a splash of water.

Simmer for 10 minutes, uncovered, until reduced a little. Taste after 5 minutes and add a little sugar if you think the tomatoes need it. Keep an eye on the texture – you don’t want it runny, but it mustn’t get too dry, either. Add another splash of water if necessary. When the sauce is reduced, stir in the herbs.

Make 8 small wells in the sauce. Break an egg into a cup and drop carefully into a well, repeat with the remaining eggs. Cook for a few more minutes until the whites are just set and the yolks are still runny. Sprinkle over the crumbled feta. Serve with yogurt or labneh on the side.
