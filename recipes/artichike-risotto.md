## Ingredients

- 6 small violet artichokes
- 1 lemon
- ½ a bunch of fresh mint , (15g)
- extra virgin olive oil
- Parmesan cheese , for grating
- 1.1 litres (2 pints) organic stock (chicken, fish or vegetable, as appropriate)
- 1 large onion
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 4 or 5 sticks of celery
- olive oil
- 70 g butter , plus 1 extra knob for frying
- 400 g risotto rice
- 2 wineglasses of dry white vermouth (dry Martini or Noilly Prat) or dry white wine
- 115 g Parmesan cheese

## Instructions
- Peel the artichokes back to their pale, light leaves, then halve them and
  remove the hairy chokes with a teaspoon. Immerse the artichokes in water with
  half the lemon juice, with a heavy lid or heat-resistant dish placed on top
  of them to keep them immersed and stop them discolouring.
- Heat the stock. Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic. Trim and finely
  chop the celery.
- Put 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the knob of butter into a separate pan,
  add the onion, garlic and celery, and cook very slowly for about 15 minutes
  without colouring. This is called a soffrito. When the vegetables have
  softened, add the rice and turn up the heat.
- The rice will now begin to lightly fry, so keep stirring it. After a minute
  it will look slightly translucent. Add the vermouth or wine and keep stirring
  – it will smell fantastic. Any harsh alcohol flavours will evaporate and
  leave the rice with a tasty essence.
- Drop 6 of your prepared artichoke halves into the simmering stock.
- Once the vermouth or wine has cooked into the rice, add your first ladle of
  hot stock and a good pinch of sea salt. Turn the heat down to a simmer so the
  rice doesn't cook too quickly on the outside. Keep adding ladlefuls of stock,
  stirring and massaging the creamy starch out of the rice, allowing each
  ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next. This will take around 15
  minutes.
- Slice the remaining artichoke halves very finely and stir into the risotto.
  Continue stirring the stock into the rice. When the rice is cooked and you
  have added the butter and Parmesan, stir in the rest of the lemon juice. Take
  the pan off the heat and check the seasoning.
- Taste the rice to check if it’s cooked. If not, carry on adding stock until
  the rice is soft but with a slight bite. Don’t forget to check the seasoning
  carefully. If you run out of stock before the rice is cooked, add some
  boiling water.
- Remove from the heat and add the 70g butter and grate in the Parmesan. Stir
  well. Place a lid on the pan and allow to sit for 2 minutes. This is the most
  important part of making the perfect risotto, as this is when it becomes
  amazingly creamy and oozy like it should be. Eat it as soon as possible,
  while it retains its beautiful texture.
- Pick and tear up the mint leaves. Remove the cooked artichokes from the stock
  pan and toss with most of the lemon zest, the torn-up mint leaves and a
  splash of olive oil.
- Spoon the risotto onto 4 plates and place the dressed artichokes on top.
  Drizzle with any remaining dressing from the bowl and serve sprinkled with
  extra Parmesan and the rest of the lemon zest.
