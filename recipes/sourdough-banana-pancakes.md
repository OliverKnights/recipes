Notes:
reduce milk, especially if using spelt flour

## Ingredients

all-purpose flour 140 grams
tbsp sugar 6 grams
.5 tsp kosher salt
baking powder 8 grams
milk 240 ml
2 eggs slightly beaten
sourdough starter 50 grams
2 tbsp melted butter 56 grams
banana mashed 118 grams

## Instructions

Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt in a large bowl.

Whisk the milk, eggs, sourdough starter, melted butter, and mashed banana together.

Pour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients.

Whisk until the mixture is smooth and combined.

Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Spray it with cooking spray or melt a dab of butter in the skillet.

Ladle some batter in the hot skillet.

Cook for about 2-4 minutes, until golden. When the top of the pancakes is bubbling, it's time to flip. Cook for another 2-4 minutes on the other side.

Remove the pancake to a plate and proceed with the remaining batter.
Keep your eye on the heat so itâ€™s not too high and burning the outsides of the pancakes while leaving the inside undercooked.

Serving options: maple syrup, berries, melted chocolate, Nutella, caramelized bananas, nut butter, honey.
