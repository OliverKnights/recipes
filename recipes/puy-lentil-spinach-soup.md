https://www.rivercottage.net/recipes/puy-lentil-and-spinach-soup

## Ingredients

2 tablespoons olive or rapeseed oil
3 shallots, or 1 onion, finely chopped
1 carrot, finely chopped
A few sprigs of thyme, leaves only, roughly chopped
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
3 tomatoes, cored, deseeded and diced
150g Puy lentils, rinsed
1.3 litres vegetable stock
A small bunch of parsley, finely chopped
100g baby spinach
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

To serve

1–2 tablespoons extra virgin olive or rapeseed oil
Parmesan, hard goat’s cheese or other well-flavoured hard cheese (optional)

## Instructions

Heat the oil over a medium-low heat in a large saucepan. Add the shallots or onion, carrot and thyme and sauté gently for 5 minutes. Add the garlic and tomatoes and sauté for a further minute.

Tip in the lentils, stir, then add the stock and a little salt and pepper. Bring the soup to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for about 25 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. Add the parsley and spinach and simmer for a further 5 minutes.

Check the seasoning, then spoon into warmed bowls, trickle over a little oil and shave over some cheese, if you like.
