https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/aubergine-halloumi-harissa-skillet-bake

## Ingredients

2-4 tbsp olive oil, plus a drizzle
1 large aubergine, sliced into rounds about ½cm thick
2 large garlic cloves, crushed
400g can chopped tomatoes
1 tbsp harissa paste
½ tsp caster sugar
225g block halloumi, sliced into 8-9 pieces
pinch of dried mint
flatbreads, rice or couscous, to serve

## Method

1. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a roughly 22cm ovenproof skillet or frying pan, then add the aubergine slices in a single layer (you’ll need to do this in batches). Cook for 2-3 mins on each side until just golden and softened, adding another 1 tbsp oil between each batch. Transfer to a plate.
2. If the pan is dry, add another 1 tbsp oil. Fry the garlic until sizzling but not coloured. Stir in the tomatoes, harissa, sugar and a pinch of salt. Bubble for a minute, squashing the tomatoes. Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly.
3. Meanwhile, halve each piece of halloumi (don’t worry if they fall apart). Arrange the aubergine and halloumi slices in overlapping concentric circles on top of the tomato mixture, ensuring there are one or two pieces of halloumi between each aubergine slice. Drizzle with a little more oil and sprinkle with the mint. Cover the pan with foil and bake for 20 mins at 180C/160C fan/gas 4, then remove the foil and bake for a further 5-10 mins until the halloumi has started to brown. Serve with warm flatbreads, rice or couscous.
