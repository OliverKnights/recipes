# Blurry Noodles
# Ingredients
-   Noodles
-   2 tbsp Gochujang
-   2 tbsp peanut butter
-   2 tsp white wine vinegar
-   2 tsp soya sauce
-   1 very small onion ( or half a big one )
-   1 garlic clove 
-   1 tbsp of sesame oil
-   (optional) Your choice of vegetables ( mushrooms, courgette etc)
    
# Preparation
1.  Finely cut the onion and garlic 
2.  If you’d like to add mushrooms or other veg, cut them up into tiny bits, as they need to cook fast.

# Method
1.  Get a saucepan of water boiling for the noodles, add the noodles once it starts to boil
2.  At the same time, put another saucepan on to medium high heat and add the sesame oil
3.  Once the oil is hot enough, add the garlic, onion and veg
4.  Fry till soft, about 5 mins I’d guess? Make sure the veg is cooked though.
5.  Add the gochujang, peanut butter, soya sauce, white wine vinegar
6.  Fry another minute to heat everything
7.  Drain the cooked noodles and add them to the sauce
