https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/grilled-courgette-halloumi-salad-with-caper-lemon-dressing

## Ingredients

10-12 baby courgettes, halved lengthways
1 tbsp olive oil
225g block halloumi, thinly sliced (about 16 slices)

For the dressing

1 long shallot, finely chopped
1 red chilli, finely chopped
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 lemon, zested and juiced
2 tbsp capers
3 tbsp olive oil

## Method

1. Put all the dressing ingredients in a bowl with 1 tbsp cold water and season with a pinch of salt. Mix together and set aside.
2. Put the courgettes in a large bowl and drizzle with the oil. Add a pinch of salt, then toss.
3. Heat a griddle pan to high and add the courgettes, cut-side down (itâ€™s best to do this in batches). Cook for 4-5 mins until char marks appear and the flesh softens, then flip over and cook for another 3 mins. Remove to a shallow bowl and cover with foil to keep warm.
4. Meanwhile, heat a separate large non-stick frying pan and add the halloumi. Cook for a few minutes until golden on both sides.
5. Arrange the courgettes and halloumi on a large plate or platter, then spoon over the dressing.
