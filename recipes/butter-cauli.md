# Butter Cauliflower

https://old.reddit.com/r/VegRecipes/comments/d5y842/vegetarian_butter_chicken/

## Ingredients

- 3 tbsp butter
- 3 gloves garlic
- 1/2 onion
- 1 tbsp fresh ginger
- 4 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp chili powder (or more to taste)
- 1 tsp cumin
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 400g pasata (non-flavoured tomato sauce)
- 500ml stock
- 1 head cauliflower
- 4 tbsp yoghurt
- some vegetable oil
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Cut the cauliflower into florets, toss it with yoghurt, vegetable oil and
   half the garam masala. Pop it in the oven at 220Â°C for 15 min max to get it
   nice and roasted.

2. Melt the butter in a high-walled pot (this will make the reducing faster and
   easier), add minced garlic gloves and onion, fry for a few minutes. Add
   ingredients until tomato paste, fry for another 4-5 min until fragrant. Add
   pasata and stock.

3. Reduce until the gravy has the desired consistency (like a relatively thick
   tomato sauce, you want it to be quite viscose/not too liquid). Add the
   cauliflower and the heavy cream, simmer for 1-2 min, serve immediately with
   rice or naan.
