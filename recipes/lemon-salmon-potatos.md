# Ingredients
300 g potatoes small with skin on, scrubbed and chopped in half or thirds (or more depending on size of potatoes)
50 g butter (3 heaped tablespoons)
2 garlic cloves crushed
0.5 lemons (juice only)
1 tablespoon sweet chili sauce
2 tablespoons parsley chopped
100 g asparagus (about 14 stems) woody parts removed
200 g cherry tomatoes
200 g salmon (2 fillets)
salt and pepper

## Instructions
Preheat the oven to 355F / 180C.
Roast the potatoes in a little olive oil on a sheet pan / baking tray for 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small saucepan, then add the garlic. Cook for a couple of minutes.
Add the lemon, sweet chili sauce and chopped parsley and stir. Remove from the heat and set aside.
Remove the sheet pan with the potatoes on from the oven and add the asparagus and tomatoes.
Tuck the salmon in amongst the vegetables, then drizzle the lemon butter sauce over the salmon. Grind plenty of salt and pepper over the whole pan.
Bake for 10 minutes until the salmon is just cooked and the potatoes are tender.
Serve drizzled with the lovely sauce and with fresh crusty bread.
