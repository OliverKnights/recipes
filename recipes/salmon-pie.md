# Salmon Pie

## Ingredients

- 1 kg Potatoes
- 2 garlic cloves crushed (optional)
- 2 large salmon fillets
- 2 stalks celery finely chopped
- 1 carrot finely chopped
- 1 cup peas (150g)
- handful vegan cheese grated
- ½ juice lemon

## Instructions

1. Pre-heat your oven to 200C
2. Roughly chop your potatoes and boil for 12 minutes (no need to peel them)
3. Meanwhile de-skin your salmon and chop into cubes and place straight into your baking dish
4. Now to the baking dish add your chopped celery stalks, carrot, 1 cup peas, handful vegan cheese, zest and juice of ½ a lemon, handful fresh parsley and spinach
5. Quickly mix with your hands
6. Now mash your potatoes (I like to use olive oil and a splash of almond milk, salt & pepper)
7. Simply top the pie ingredients with the mash and roughly spread around the top with a fork (make sure to press in the sides)
8. Bake for 30 minutes at 200C
