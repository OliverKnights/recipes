# Carrot and Coriander Soup

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 4 garlic cloves, crushed
- 2 small red onions or 1 large, diced
- 1kg carrots, roughly chopped
- 1 litre veg stock (good quality)
- 1 tsp dried coriander leaf
- handful fresh coriander
- salt & pepper

## Instructions

1. Place a large pan on a low/medium heat with the olive oil and crushed garlic until it’s sizzling
2. Dice the red onion and add to the pan along with a pinch of salt and pepper
3. Meanwhile roughly chop the carrots (I use organic so don’t bother peeling) and add straight to the pan along with the teaspoon of dried coriander, a pinch of salt & pepper and cook down for 5 minutes
4. Add 1 litre of veg stock and reduce to a simmer for 30 minutes making sure to place the lid back on the pan
5. Simply add the handful of fresh coriander (you can add more to your taste) with the stalks and hand blend or place in a blender/processor
