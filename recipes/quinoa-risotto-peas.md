https://gasmarkfive.com/2016/04/15/quinoa-risotto-with-mashed-peas-and-greens/

## Ingredients

  - 2 leeks
  - olive oil
  - 2 cloves garlic
  - 250g quinoa
  - 200ml white wine
  - 1 lemon
  - 1tbsp veg stock powder or 1/2 a cube
  - 250g frozen peas
  - 200g spring greens or spinach
  - a few springs of mint
  - 1/2 bunch basil
  - 60g Parmesan cheese
  - 100g ricotta or feta cheese

## Instructions

  - Wash and slice leeks and cook in olive oil until starting to brown, then add chopped garlic and cook for a couple of minutes. Add the quinoa and cook for a few minutes allowing to pop (apparently this makes it tastes better. Unfortunately I accidentally threw in the wine at this stage having picked up the wrong jug!).
  - Once the quinoa has popped for a few minutes add the wine and juice of half a lemon and cook until it has evaporated. Add the stock powder and 600ml of water and bring to a gentle simmer.
  - Weigh out the peas and cover with boiling water until defrosted. Shred the greens (I used spinach as I already has some in the fridge), and dry fry the pine nuts until browned.
  - Drain the peas and blitz with the mint and basil leaves, the juice of the other half of lemon a tablespoon of olive oil and a pinch of salt. (I omitted the salt as I’m so used to cooking without it for the boy).
  - When the quinoa is cooked, add the shredded greens, grated Parmesan and black pepper and pop a lid on. (I gave it a good stir to wilt the spinach as I didn’t shred it and simply threw in a couple of good handfuls).
  
To serve, top the quinoa risotto with the pea mash (I would liken this to a pea, mint and basil pesto), toasted pine nuts and crumbled feta or ricotta and a grating of Parmesan.
