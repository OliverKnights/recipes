https://healthylivingjames.co.uk/asian-buckwheat-noodles/

## Ingredients

- 160 Buckwheat noodles
- 1 carrot
- 1 small courgette
- Large hand full of sunblushed tomatoes
- Large hand full of kale
- Pinch of chilli flakes
- Pinch of sesame seeds

### Sauce

- 4 tablespoons tahini
- 4 tablespoons tamari
- 2 teaspoon of maple syrup/honey
- 6-8 tablespoons water

## Instructions

Mix sauce ingredients together

1. First off boil some water and place the buckwheat noodles in, turn down to a medium/low heat and boil for 5 minutes.
2. Whilst the noodles are cooking place a frying pan on medium heat and add a teaspoon of coconut oil into the pan.
3. Now start off peeling half a carrot length ways onto a chopping board doing the same with the courgette.
4. Once the pan is ready cut the sun blushed tomatoes with scissors into small pieces straight into the pan.
5. Now add the kale, carrots, courgette and a pinch chilli flakes, salt and pepper. Allow these to cook for a couple minutes.
6. Once this is cooked turn off the heat to the pan and pour half the sauce over and stir in.
7. The noodles will be cooked now so drain them and place into a mixing bowl. Pour the ingredients from the pan into the mixing bowl as well along with the other half of the sauce and mix around until evenly covered.
8. Now its ready to serve. I finish mine off with another pinch of chilli flakes and sesame seeds.
