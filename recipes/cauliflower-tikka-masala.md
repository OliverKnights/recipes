## Ingredients

- 60g unsalted cashews
- 1 pinch saffron
- 1 tbls mango chutney
- 1 lemon
- 2 tbls natural yog
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- olive oil
- 200g Paneer cheese
- 1/2 cauliflower (400g)
- 1 knob unsalted butter
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 3 cloves
- 3 cardamom pods
- 4 cloves garlic
- 1 onion
- 5cm peice of ginger
- 2 tablespoons sun dried tomato paste
- 4 sprigs fresh coriander

## Instructions
Put the cashews, saffron and mango chutney into a jug, cover with 700ml of
boiling water and leave to one side to soak. Preheat the grill to high. Finely grate
the lemon zest into a large bowl, add the yoghurt, paprika, a pinch of sea salt and
black pepper and 1 tablespoon of oil, and mix well. Chop the paneer into 2cm
cubes and break the cauliflower into florets (roughly the same size), then toss
in the marinade. Tip into a large roasting tray and grill on the middle shelf for
12 minutes, or until beautifully golden and gnarly at the edges.

Put the butter and 1 teaspoon of oil into a large casserole pan on a low heat with
the cinnamon and cloves, and bash the cardamom pods, adding just the inner
seeds. Peel, finely slice and add the garlic, and cook for a few minutes, stirring
occasionally. Peel the onion and ginger, roughly chop, then place in a blender
with the tomato paste and a good splash of boiling water, and whiz to a paste.
Pour into the pan and cook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly.

Tip the cashew mixture into the blender and whiz until super-smooth - you may
need to work in batches. Pour into the pan, bring to the boil, then leave to tick
away for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the paneer and cauliflower, season
to perfection with salt and pepper, then place under the grill. Once golden and
bubbling, stir back through and pick over the coriander leaves.
Delicious served with fluffy rice and wedges of lemon for squeezing over.
