# Babish recipe

Good, a little to cakey, I think because I used too much mix for my size tray,
and overcooked them.

## Ingredients

371g white sugar
226 unsalted butter, melted
1.5 tsp espresso powder
1 tsp vanilla extract
4 eggs plus 2 egg yolks
100g cocoa powder
109g vegetable oil
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp kosher salt
170g bittersweet chocolate, chopped
190g bread flour

## Instructions

Line a 9x13 inch pan with parchment paper and oil the whole thing down with vegetable oil.
In a large bowl, combine the white sugar, melted butter, espresso powder, and vanilla extract, 4 eggs, and 2 egg yolks. Whisk to combine.
Add cocoa powder, vegetable oil, and chopped chocolate. Whisk to combine.
In a separate bowl, combine bread flour, salt, and baking powder. Add to the rest of the ingredients and stir to combine. Don’t worry about overmixing.
Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake at 350°F for 25-35 minutes, or until your desired doneness has been achieved
