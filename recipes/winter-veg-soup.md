-   Drain and rinse the cannellini beans and add these along with the tomatoes and stock.
-   Bring to the boil and simmer for 20 minutes. Add the cabbage and spinach and season well with salt and pepper. Cook for a further 5 minutes.
-   Serve with a spoonful of pistou and a sprinkling of freshly grated parmesan cheese and some crusty bread on the side.
