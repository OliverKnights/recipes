https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/roast-aubergines-yogurt-harissa

## Ingredients 

4 aubergines
2 tbsp olive oil
75g butter
1 tbsp shop-bought harissa
6 tbsp Greek yogurt
1 small garlic clove , crushed
1 tbsp chopped coriander
1 tsp sesame seeds

## Method

1. Heat the oven to 200C/190C fan/gas 6. Pierce the aubergines a few times with the tip of a knife, then brush with olive oil and put them on a baking sheet. Roast for about 40-45 mins, or until the aubergines are completely tender.
2. Melt the butter in a pan, then stir through the harissa (see our recipe). Cut the aubergines in half, opening them up a bit like a baked potato. Put them on a warm platter and season the inside of each one, then mix the yogurt with the garlic. Spoon some of this into each aubergine, then drizzle over the spiced butter. Scatter over the coriander and sesame seeds to serve.
