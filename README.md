## Sourdough

### Sourdough discard naan bread

https://midwestniceblog.com/sourdough-discard-naan-recipe

#### Ingredients

80g ½ cup sourdough starter discard
60g ¼ cup whole milk warmed slightly
2 tablespoon full fat Greek yogurt or sour cream
180g 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour divded
½ tsp. baking powder
Pinch of salt
1 tablespoon melted butter
1 tablespoon minced garlic

#### Method

In a large measuring cup, whisk together the starter, milk, and Greek yogurt.
In a separate bowl, whisk together 1 cup of the flour, baking powder, and salt.
Pour liquid ingredients into dry and whisk until a loose, somewhat sticky dough is formed. If dough seems too sticky, add additional flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Dough is ready when it is tacky but not sticky. Cover with a clean dish towel and let rest in a warm place for 1 – 2 hours.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about three minutes. Cut into four equal pieces.
Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out each piece of dough into a circular/oval shape. Cover again with a dishtowel and let rest for five to ten minutes.
While the naan rests, preheat a large griddle over medium-high heat. One by one, place the shaped naan onto heated surface. Cook for three to four minutes on one side, dough should puff up and form bubbles, kind of like pancakes. Flip over and cook for three to four minutes more. Repeat process with remaining dough.
While naan is still warm, brush with melted butter and sprinkle with additional salt, fresh garlic, chopped parsley or other seasonings, if desired.

### Sourdough discard tortillas

https://milkandpop.com/the-best-sourdough-tortillas/

pinch of salt

### Sourdough flatbread

### Sourdough focaccia

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_W52dypZpA

130g sourdough discard (100% hydration)
140g water
6g fine sea salt
15g olive oil
200g bread flour

Procedure:
Let the sourdough discard sit at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours, depending on your kitchen temperature. If your discard is still active and bubbly, you can skip this step.
In a bowl, add active sourdough discard, water, salt, olive oil, and flour. Stir until no dry flour is left. Cover and let it rest for 1 hour. Perform 3 times stretch and fold then cover and let the dough rest again every 30 minutes. After the last stretch and fold, transfer the dough into a baking dish lined with baking paper. Cover and place it in the fridge (5C/41F) overnight or up to 2 days. My baking dish size is 23cmx23cm or 9×9 inches.
Take the focaccia dough out of the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for 1 hour to 2 hours. 30 minutes before baking preheat the oven (up and down heat) to 230C / 446F. Drizzle the top of the dough with olive oil, dimple the dough then add your toppings. Bake the focaccia for 25 to 30 minutes. Let the focaccia cool in the pan for 10 minutes.
